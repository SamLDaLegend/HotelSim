# PARKING

Everything discovered mid-goal that is not in the goal. It gets written down here and
it does not get built now (`HOTELSIM.md` §4).

If a proposed feature does not feed the guest loop, the money loop or the build loop,
this is where it lives — not in the sprint.

**PARKING.md not growing is a stop condition** (§9). It means scope is leaking into
goals instead of being deferred.

Format: one line, with the goal or session it came out of and where it belongs.

## Deferred during bootstrap (2026-08-07)

- **Lint and format (ESLint / Prettier / Biome)** — no linter is configured. The six
  invariant gates plus strict TypeScript are the quality bar for M0. Revisit after M0
  sign-off; a linter now would generate churn the critics have to read past.
- **Coverage thresholds** — `pnpm test` reports coverage but enforces no number.
  Deliberate: §9 lists "test coverage added to satisfy a number rather than to pin
  behaviour" as an anti-pattern. Revisit only if coverage turns out to be falling.
- **Git hooks / pre-commit `pnpm verify`** — CI runs it; local hooks can wait.
- **Migration test fixtures** — `packages/sim/src/save.ts` has an empty migration list
  because nothing predates v1. The first real schema bump needs a stored v1 fixture
  blob committed to the repo so migrations are tested against real old data, not
  against a synthesised one. -> G-003 or first bump after it.
- **`Set`/`Map` iteration-order detection in the determinism gate** — statically
  undecidable in general, so `test:determinism` bans the wall-clock and unseeded-random
  sources mechanically and leaves iteration order to `sim-critic`'s failure catalogue.
  Revisit if a real divergence ever slips through.
- **A `--json` output mode for `sim:run`** — the balance critic's standing mandate is to
  run 1000-day simulations across many seeds and report a distribution. Parsing the
  human-readable summary will get old. -> M4, or G-006 if it is cheap.
- **Benchmarking tick cost against agent count** — `sim:bench` measures total wall time
  for 365 days, which catches a slowdown but does not tell you whether cost is linear
  in agent count. §6.1 asks `sim-critic` to watch for worse-than-linear growth; a
  dedicated scaling bench would make that mechanical. -> M3, when there are enough
  agents for it to mean anything.
- **`packageManager` / corepack** — pnpm was installed globally via npm because corepack
  could not write shims into `C:\Program Files\nodejs`. CI pins pnpm explicitly, so this
  only affects local dev on this machine.

## Deferred out of G-001 (2026-08-07)

Raised by `sim-engineer` at PLAN and deliberately kept out of the diff.

- **Typed component data on entities** — position, occupancy, need vectors. `Entity` is
  `{id, kind}` and nothing more at G-001. -> G-002 / G-004.
- **A system registry / ordered `runSystems` phase** — the slot between `applyCommands`
  and `commitEntities` is documented in a comment in `tick.ts`. Deliberately not written
  as an empty phase named after a feature that does not exist. -> the first goal that
  needs a second system.
- **Command acknowledgements** — the host learning which id a `spawnEntity` produced.
  Predictable today because ids are monotonic, but brittle to rely on. -> whenever a
  host actually needs it.
- **Validating `Entity.kind` against injected content at spawn time** — needs the content
  pipeline to exist. -> G-002.
- **`assertWorldShape` rejecting unknown top-level keys** — real hardening, belongs with
  the migration work rather than ahead of it. -> G-003.
- **Secondary indices (`kind -> EntityId[]`)** for O(1) queries by kind. Would be derived,
  rebuilt on load, never hashed. Not needed until a query is measurably slow. -> M2/M3.
- **Entity generation counters** for stale-handle detection. Monotonic non-reused ids
  already make a stale handle *fail* rather than *alias*, which is the property that
  matters. -> only if handles start being held across saves.
- **`spawnedAt` on `Entity`** — would make phase ordering directly observable in state.
  Probably useful, but G-004 may want `Entity` shaped differently. -> G-004.
- **`sim:bench` (I5) does not exercise the entity store** — the CLI runs with no command
  schedule, so 365 days simulate zero entities and the bench says nothing about tick cost
  under load. Fixing it means giving the CLI a real workload, which is G-006's day cycle.
  -> **G-006, treat as a dependency**. This sharpens the earlier parked item about
  benchmarking tick cost against agent count.

## Deferred out of G-002 (2026-08-07)

Raised by `sim-engineer` at PLAN. The first two are **gate defects** — gates are
orchestrator-owned (ADR-0004), so they are fixed in their own labelled commit rather
than inside a feature diff.

- ~~**GATE DEFECT — `check:content` skips wrapper objects.**~~ **RESOLVED `8f1b7ff`.**
  The old logic inspected **0 ids** for any wrapper-object or nested file while reporting
  "ok". Now walks the document depth-first with a JSON-path breadcrumb; a file yielding
  no ids at all, and duplicate ids, are both violations.
- ~~**GATE DEFECT — the snake_case pattern is written twice.**~~ **RESOLVED `8f1b7ff`.**
  `tools/gates/lib/content-id.mjs` is now the source of truth, with
  `content-id-agreement.test.ts` cross-checking it against the live Zod schema on 16
  hand-picked and 729 generated ids — two live values, not a copied literal.
- **A `--content <path>` flag for `sim:run`** so a host can inject alternative content,
  and so the CLI's non-zero exit on bad content is testable without a temp repo.
  -> G-006, or whenever the balance sweeps need it.
- **Projecting the content fingerprint to sim-visible fields only** — today *any*
  injected field moves the fingerprint, including display-only text, so a typo fix in a
  room's `name` invalidates saves. Conservative direction (false alarm, never silent
  divergence), deliberately chosen at G-002. -> revisit when content churn makes it hurt.
- **Migrating saves across a content change** — today the answer is "refuse to load, with
  a legible error". Accepted for M0, where a content edit genuinely is a different
  simulation. It will not survive M6, where content churn is constant. -> M5/M6.
- **Rooms as spatial entities** — grid position, enclosure, doors. G-002 gives the sim a
  room *type*, not a room. -> M1.
- **Room variety, items, staff roles, guest archetypes** (M6) and **construction cost**
  (M1). The schema is deliberately one table with four fields.
- **`apps/game` loading content** -> M5, and not before M0 sign-off (§9).

## Deferred out of G-004 (2026-08-07)

Raised by `ai-engineer` at PLAN and BUILD, and deliberately kept out of the diff.

- **A demand model inside the simulation.** Arrival is a `guestArrives` COMMAND issued by
  the host, on a fixed cadence, because how often guests turn up is demand and demand is
  M4. The consequence to keep in view: `--seed` does not yet change guest behaviour at
  all — the guest loop draws no randomness — so `sim:run --days 30 --seed 7` and
  `--seed 8` differ only in the RNG stream carried in state. -> **M4**, and note it
  against G-006 so nobody reads `--seed` as a claim about guest variety.
- **`--rooms` and `--arrivals` flags for `sim:run`.** The CLI seeds a fixed 3 rooms and
  one arrival every 120 ticks, as named constants. Tuning them from the command line is
  useful for balance sweeps. -> **G-006**, with `--json` and `--content`.
- **A room -> occupant index. MEASURED THRESHOLD: I5 FAILS ABOVE ~50 ROOMS. -> M1, not
  M2/M3.** Finding a free room is O(rooms) per waiting guest per tick, so the guest loop
  is O(waiting x rooms). `ai-critic` measured it at G-004, balanced hotel, 365 days
  against the 10s budget:

  | rooms | guests | µs/tick | 365-day projection |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 3 | 3 | 1.01 | 0.5s — what ships today |
  | 25 | 34 | 8.10 | 4.3s |
  | 50 | 48 | 10.15 | 5.3s |
  | 75 | 105 | 52.67 | **27.7s — I5 fails** |

  Isolated: 1000 rooms with 0 guests costs 0.58 µs, 1 room with 5 guests costs 1.45 µs —
  neither term alone matters, the product does. **M1 is the milestone that hands room
  count to the player**, so it meets this as a known cost, the way ADR-0006 made G-004
  meet the save fixture. Deliberately NOT optimised at G-004: I5 is green at 10.5% and
  stays green through M0, because the bench runs 3 rooms and neither G-005 nor G-006 adds
  any. Optimising against a gate that is not failing is speculative work.

  If it is ever built it is DERIVED state — rebuilt on load, never saved, never
  authoritative — because the single source of truth for a reservation is the field on
  the guest, and a second copy is exactly how this class of leak is normally introduced.
- **The per-tick guest invariant scan, severable from the index above.**
  `assertGuestStoreInvariants` and `assertGuestOutcomes` run on **every** tick and cost
  ~7.24 µs/tick at 96 guests — roughly a quarter of that case's total — rebuilding a `Set`
  and binary-searching per resting guest, 1,440 times a simulated day, to check a
  postcondition the tick cannot violate. Defensible at 3 guests, load-bearing at 100.
  Cheaper to address than the index and independent of it: sample it, or gate it behind
  the same reasoning that makes `commitEntityDraft` return by reference on an idle tick.
  **Do not simply delete it** — it is what makes a reservation leak loud, and it runs at
  load as well as at commit. -> M1, with the index.
- **`appendTransaction` copies the whole log on every append.** 3,282 appends over 365
  days is nothing; ten times the arrival density would not be. Flagged against the file
  that owns it. -> **G-005**.
- **Splitting the outcome tally by reason.** `unsatisfied` is "gave up waiting" and
  `evicted` is "the room stopped existing"; when guests can fail for more reasons than
  that, the tally wants to become a table rather than four counters. -> M2, with reviews.
- **Party size.** `capacity` is the size of the party a room holds, and a party is one
  guest at M0, so a room takes at most one booking. Multi-guest parties need arrivals to
  carry a size. -> M1/M6.
- **Need decay and the need vector.** One need, formed on arrival, satisfied by one
  provider, with no decay and no scoring. -> M2.
- **Reviews.** A guest leaves with a recorded outcome, not an opinion. The outcome is the
  raw material a review is computed from. -> M2.
- **Moving payment to nightly settlement.** G-004 pays once per satisfied stay through a
  single `payForStay` seam with one call site, so G-005 replaces the seam rather than
  editing guest behaviour. -> G-005.
- **Turn-away at the door.** A guest who finds the hotel full waits in the lobby and
  gives up when its patience runs out; there is no "saw the queue and left" path,
  because that is a demand behaviour. -> M4.
- **GATE OBSERVATION — `check:content` cannot see a cross-reference.** `collectIds` walks
  the document for `id` fields, so `"provides": ["nihgt_rest"]` in `room-types.json` is
  invisible to it. Not fixed here: gates are orchestrator-owned (ADR-0004), and
  `bindContent` rejecting an unprovided need and an undefined reference — on every host
  start, against the actually-parsed registry — is a stronger check than a text scan
  could be. Recorded so the choice is deliberate rather than an oversight.
- **`sim:bench` now does real work.** The 365-day run simulates 4,380 arrivals and 3,282
  paid stays instead of zero entities, which is most of the parked G-001 item about the
  bench exercising nothing. I5 moved 8.8% -> ~16% of budget for that reason. What is
  still missing is tick cost measured AGAINST agent count rather than in total. -> M3.

// I3 — CONTENT IS DATA. The schema half.
//
// Every room type, item, staff role and guest archetype is JSON on disk, validated
// here before anything is allowed to reach the simulation. `packages/sim` never sees
// zod and never sees an unvalidated object.
//
// This module reads nothing. No filesystem, no network, no bundler-specific JSON
// import: it takes bytes or a parsed value from a caller and validates them. Whoever
// wants a file read does it themselves (`tools/headless/src/content-loader.ts`), which
// is why this package's tsconfig can keep `"types": []` and prove it.
